                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 Chatbot is a software application designed to replicate human conversation. The bot employs pre-established rules to simulate real-life interactions and respond to customer inquiries promptly.

                                    h2.fw-bolder.mb-4.mt-5 What is a chatbot? 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 Chatbot is an automated program that operates as a valuable tool to enhance customer convenience. It interacts with users in a manner similar to human conversation. What sets them apart is their cost-effectiveness. They require little to no expense for engagement. Thus making them a practical and efficient solution for various customer interactions.   

                                    h2.fw-bolder.mb-4.mt-5 How do chatbots work?
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 Chatbots primarily fall into two categories: rule-based chatbots and AI chatbots. 
                                                                        
                                    h3.fw-bolder.mb-4.mt-5 01. Rule-based chatbots 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 Rule-based chatbots generate responses based on a predefined set of rules. These rules are established by their developers. These bots typically analyse input, whether it be text or speech, for specific keywords. Then, they generate responses based on these identified keywords. 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 For instance, if a user informs a rule-based chatbot, "I'm really excited for the upcoming basketball game," the bot may recognise keywords like 'basketball' and 'game' and reply with a prompt such as, "Tell me your favourite sports team."
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 While rule-based chatbots operate on a straightforward set of rules, they often prove effective enough to successfully navigate basic interactions. And even pass the Turing test* in many instances. However, for more in-depth conversations, AI chatbots tend to provide a more convincing experience. 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 *The Turing test was devised by renowned computer scientist Alan Turing. The test assesses a machine's ability to exhibit human-like behaviour. If a human cannot discern whether they are interacting with a human or a machine, the machine is considered to have passed the Turing test. 
                                    h3.fw-bolder.mb-4.mt-5 02. AI chatbots 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 An AI chatbot uses machine learning to enhance its capabilities through interactions with users. Unlike rule-based chatbots that rely on keywords, AI chatbots are crafted to comprehend language intricacies.  
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 The power of AI chatbots lies in their ability to simulate realistic human conversations more effectively. However, designing and managing AI chatbots poses significantly greater challenges. Additionally, the costs are significantly higher.
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 Furthermore, design flaws in these bots can result in unexpected and undesirable behaviours. A notable instance is Microsoft's 'Tay,' an AI chatbot introduced on Twitter in 2016. Unfortunately, within 24 hours of its launch, Tay began producing offensive and inflammatory comments. The comments were partially influenced by a few Twitter users who quickly learned how to manipulate the bot's behaviour.
