                                    h2.fw-bolder.mb-4.mt-5 How does a contact form work? 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 This is the primary processes involved in visitor interactions with a contact form. Let's review each step in detail:

                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 03. Display the error to the user (form client error message). A red error message appears under each field that failed validation, explaining the reason for the failure. The user must rectify the error and resend the form (return to step 2). Assuming correct entries this time, and successful validation, proceed to the next step. 
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 04. Form field validation is activated on the server-side. The server performs a final validation check.

Although not explicitly depicted in the diagram, if reCAPTCHA is employed, its validation is included at this stage.
                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 05. Dispatch auto-response email. If enabled, an email is generated and sent to the visitor's email address.

                                    p.fs-5.mb-4 07. Display the Thank You message (form thank you message). The form is concealed, and a thank you message is presented to the visitor.
